## Development

### Backend

Run the FastAPI backend with automatic restart and heartbeat checks:

```bash
./start_backend.sh
```

This script uses `python_backend/keep_alive.py` to restart the server if it
crashes and to periodically ping the `/health` endpoint so hosting platforms do
not suspend the process due to inactivity.
