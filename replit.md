### Backend Architecture
- **Primary Backend**: Python FastAPI (port 8000) for all API logic and database operations.
- **Proxy Layer**: Node.js Express.js server (port 5000) serves the frontend and proxies API requests.
- **Language**: Python with Pydantic models and async/await.
- **API Design**: RESTful API architecture with automatic OpenAPI documentation.
- **Database Operations**: Direct PostgreSQL queries with asyncpg and a repository pattern.
- **RBAC System**: Comprehensive role-based access control with 26 permissions, 6 role templates, and a multi-tenant architecture, including row-level security and integer-based permissions.

### Database Architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless database.
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations.
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema management.
- **Connection**: Connection pooling with `@neondatabase/serverless`.

### Core System Features
- **Users**: Role-based access (crew, manager, admin) and comprehensive user management.
- **Projects**: Status tracking, progress monitoring, and CRUD operations.
- **Tasks**: Assignment, priority management, inline status updates, and visual indicators.
