## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Components**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui design system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom construction-themed color palette
- **Build Tool**: Vite

### Backend Architecture
- **Primary Backend**: Python FastAPI (port 8000) for all API logic and database operations - **OPERATIONAL**
- **Proxy Layer**: Node.js Express.js server (port 5000) serves frontend and proxies API requests
- **Language**: Python with Pydantic models and async/await
- **API Design**: RESTful API architecture with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- **Database Operations**: Direct PostgreSQL queries with asyncpg and repository pattern
- **RBAC System**: Comprehensive role-based access control with 26 permissions, 6 role templates, multi-tenant architecture

### Database Architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless database
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema management
- **Connection**: Connection pooling with @neondatabase/serverless

### Core System Features
- **Users**: Role-based access (crew, manager, admin)
- **Projects**: Status tracking and progress monitoring
- **Tasks**: Assignment and priority management
- **Project Logs**: Documentation for activities and issues
- **Photos**: Image documentation with project association and metadata
- **Schedule Changes**: System for schedule modifications

### Data Flow
- **Client-Server Communication**: Frontend requests through TanStack Query are proxied by Express.js to the Python FastAPI backend, which handles logic and database interactions via a repository pattern with asyncpg.
- **Photo Upload Flow**: Client uploads photos via FormData to `/api/photos`, processed by Multer, stored locally in `/uploads`, and metadata saved to the database.
- **Real-time Features**: Notifications refetch periodically, dashboard stats update on mutations, and optimistic updates for task status changes.

### Key Technical Implementations
- **Task Management**: Comprehensive system with dual creation paths (main page and project dropdowns), tabbed interface (Overview, By Projects, Administrative, General), inline status updates, and visual indicators.
- **Project Management**: CRUD operations for projects including detailed editing functionality.
- **Schedule Management**: Timeline and Calendar views for tasks and deadlines, with immediate direct task updates (no approval workflow).
- **Subcontractor Task Management**: Comprehensive system with mandatory project selection and organized views ("By Projects," "By Subcontractors," "Milestones").
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Designed for granular control with row-level security, role templates, and integer-based permissions.
