## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Components**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui design system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a custom construction-themed color palette (Deep Space Blue, Sphere Teal, Spark Coral, Cloud White, Mist Grey, Graphite Ink)
- **Branding**: Rebranded to Proesphere with a custom sphere-style logo, updated landing page copy, and a unified design system with Teal icons and professional interaction states.
- **Build Tool**: Vite

### Backend Architecture
- **Primary Backend**: Python FastAPI (port 8000) for all API logic and database operations.
- **Proxy Layer**: Node.js Express.js server (port 5000) serves the frontend and proxies API requests.
- **Language**: Python with Pydantic models and async/await.
- **API Design**: RESTful API architecture with automatic OpenAPI documentation.
- **Database Operations**: Direct PostgreSQL queries with asyncpg and a repository pattern.
- **RBAC System**: Comprehensive role-based access control with 26 permissions, 6 role templates, and a multi-tenant architecture, including row-level security and integer-based permissions.

### Database Architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless database.
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations.
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema management.
- **Connection**: Connection pooling with `@neondatabase/serverless`.

### Core System Features
- **Users**: Role-based access (crew, manager, admin) and comprehensive user management.
- **Projects**: Status tracking, progress monitoring, and CRUD operations.
- **Tasks**: Assignment, priority management, inline status updates, and visual indicators.
- **Project Logs**: Documentation for activities and issues.
- **Photos**: Image documentation with project association and metadata.
- **Schedule Changes**: System for schedule modifications with Timeline and Calendar views.
- **Notifications**: Real-time notification system.
- **Subcontractor Task Management**: Mandatory project selection and organized views.
- **Visual Project Health Assessment Tool**: Project health monitoring with health score rings, risk matrices, project health cards, and a comprehensive dashboard, including real-time health score calculation and risk assessment.

### Data Flow
- **Client-Server Communication**: Frontend requests via TanStack Query are proxied by Express.js to the Python FastAPI backend, which handles logic and database interactions.
- **Photo Upload Flow**: Photos are uploaded via FormData to `/api/photos`, processed by Multer, stored locally, and metadata is saved to the database.
