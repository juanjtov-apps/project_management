## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Components**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui design system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a custom construction-themed color palette (Deep Space Blue, Sphere Teal, Spark Coral, Cloud White, Mist Grey, Graphite Ink)
- **Branding**: Rebranded to Proesphere with a custom sphere-style logo, updated landing page copy, and a unified design system with Teal icons and professional interaction states.
- **Build Tool**: Vite

### Backend Architecture
- **Primary Backend**: Python FastAPI (port 8000) for all API logic and database operations.
- **Language**: Python with Pydantic models and async/await.
- **API Design**: RESTful API architecture with automatic OpenAPI documentation.
- **Database Operations**: Direct PostgreSQL queries with asyncpg and a repository pattern.
- **RBAC System**: Comprehensive role-based access control with 26 permissions, 6 role templates, and a multi-tenant architecture, including row-level security and integer-based permissions.

### Database Architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless database.
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations.
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema management.
- **Connection**: Connection pooling with `@neondatabase/serverless`.

### RBAC System (Role-Based Access Control)
**Production-ready three-tier access control system with complete tenant isolation.**

#### Access Tiers:
1. **Root Admin**: Platform-wide access for system administrators
   - User ID '0' or specific whitelisted emails (chacjjlegacy@proesphera.com, admin@proesphere.com)
   - Can access all companies, users, and projects across the platform
   - Access to `/api/admin/*` endpoints for platform management

2. **Company Admin**: Company-scoped user management
   - Can manage users within their own company only
   - Can invite users, assign roles, suspend/activate accounts
   - Access to `/api/company-admin/*` endpoints
   - Cannot modify root admin users or users from other companies

3. **Regular Users**: Role-based permissions (admin, manager, crew, contractor, client)
   - Permissions determine available navigation and features
   - All data access filtered by company_id for tenant isolation

#### Backend Security (Python FastAPI):
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication with `/api/auth/user` endpoint
- **Permission System**: Navigation permissions returned from auth endpoint
  - Permissions: dashboard, projects, tasks, photos, schedule, logs, projectHealth, crew, subs, rbacAdmin, clientPortal, clientPortalPayments
- **Tenant Isolation**: All endpoints enforce company_id scoping
  - Projects API: GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE with company validation
  - Tasks API: All CRUD operations with company filtering
  - Photos API: Upload, retrieval, and deletion with company checks
  - Root admin can bypass company restrictions
- **Admin Endpoints**:
  - `/api/admin/companies` - Platform-wide company management
  - `/api/admin/users` - Platform-wide user listing
  - `/api/admin/projects` - Platform-wide project access
  - `/api/admin/stats` - Platform statistics
  - `/api/company-admin/invite` - Invite users to company
  - `/api/company-admin/users/{id}/role` - Update user role (PUT with {"role": string})
  - `/api/company-admin/users/{id}/activate` - Activate user (sets is_active=true)
  - `/api/company-admin/users/{id}/suspend` - Suspend user (sets is_active=false)
- **User Management Features**:
  - Database: Users table includes `is_active` boolean column for activation status
  - Frontend: RBAC Admin page shows flat user list for company admins, collapsible by company for root admins
  - TypeScript: UserProfile interface supports both snake_case (backend) and camelCase (frontend compatibility) field names

#### Frontend Security (React):
- **Role-Based Navigation**: Sidebar automatically filters menu items based on user permissions
- **Route Protection**: ProtectedRoute component guards sensitive routes
  - Protected routes: /rbac, /rbac-admin, /client-portal, /crew, /subs
  - Automatic redirect to /dashboard for unauthorized access
- **Permission-Aware UI**: Components check permissions before rendering features

#### Security Features:
- **Cross-Company Protection**: Users cannot access data from other companies
- **Root Admin Bypass**: Root admins can access all data for platform management
- **Validation Layers**: 
  - Frontend: Route guards and UI permission checks
  - Backend: Endpoint authentication and company_id validation
- **Secure Invite Flow**: Temporary passwords not logged (secure email delivery to be implemented)

#### Role Capabilities:
- **Admin**: Full access to company features, RBAC management, client portal (including payments tab)
- **Manager**: Access to projects, tasks, client portal (excluding payments), crew management
- **Project Manager**: Same access as Manager - projects, tasks, client portal (excluding payments), crew management
- **Office Manager**: Same access as Manager - projects, tasks, client portal (excluding payments), crew management
- **Crew**: Access to assigned tasks, photos, basic project info
- **Contractor**: Limited to assigned tasks and relevant photos
- **Client**: Access to client portal for their projects only (excluding payments)
