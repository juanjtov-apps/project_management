## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a custom construction-themed color palette.
- **Branding**: Proesphere with a custom sphere-style logo and unified design system.
- **Key Features**: Tablet-optimized UI for Task Management, Projects, and Dashboard modules, including virtualization for lists, multi-select capabilities, and persistent filter states.
- **Critical Fix (Oct 2025)**: Resolved complete UI freeze in Work module by implementing synchronous dialog state management. All mutation handlers now close dialogs and reset forms BEFORE invalidating queries, eliminating focus trap issues and render loops.

### Database
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless database.
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations and schema management.
