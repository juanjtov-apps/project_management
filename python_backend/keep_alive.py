"""Utility to keep the FastAPI backend alive.

The original project relied on the hosting environment to keep the Python
process running.  When the environment became less stable we added this small
supervisor that starts the backend, restarts it on failure and periodically
performs a simple health check.  The health check pings the backend which helps
prevent certain platforms (such as Replit) from suspending the instance due to
inactivity.  The script has no external dependencies and can be executed from
any working directory.
