Goal
Unify Projects and Tasks into one Work area for tablet while preserving routes and backend APIs.

Scope
Front end only. React with Tailwind and shadcn ui. Do not touch database schemas, API endpoints, or permissions. Target widths from 768 to 1024.

Tasks
	1.	Create src/pages/WorkPage.tsx
• Header with breadcrumb Work and a centered segmented control Projects and Tasks
• Right side actions Search icon, Notifications icon, Avatar
• Sticky header height sixty. Ensure minimum tap targets forty eight by forty eight
• Persist selected segment in localStorage work.segment
	2.	Projects segment
• Render the existing Projects index inside WorkPage content
• Ensure grid is two columns on tablet and one on narrow screens
• Keep search, filters, sort, and New project button
• Remove any duplicate page title and KPIs to avoid double headers
	3.	Tasks segment
• Render the existing Task Management list inside WorkPage content
• Keep the stat cards at the top because they are specific to tasks
• Ensure filters and saved views work and persist across segments
• Group by project with collapsible headers and inline quick edits
	4.	Routing
• Add route /work that mounts WorkPage and defaults to the Projects segment
• Keep /projects and /tasks. When navigated directly, wrap their content in the same header used by WorkPage so the experience stays consistent
• Update left nav to replace separate Projects and Tasks entries with a single Work entry. Add quick links beneath Work as secondary links Projects and Tasks if space allows
	5.	Shared components
• Segmented control, FilterBar, StatCard, ProjectCard, TaskRow live in src/components/ui
• Do not duplicate these components across segments
	6.	Accessibility and performance
• All icon buttons have aria labels
• Single scroll container below the header to keep sticky elements stable
• Virtualize task list over one hundred rows with react window

Acceptance
• Work shows a Projects segment and a Tasks segment with a single sticky header
• Left nav has a Work entry and the old routes still deep link correctly
• No duplicate summary cards and no repeated Proesphere branding in the header
• Lighthouse accessibility score at least ninety on tablet widths
• Filters and saved views persist when switching segments and when returning to Work
