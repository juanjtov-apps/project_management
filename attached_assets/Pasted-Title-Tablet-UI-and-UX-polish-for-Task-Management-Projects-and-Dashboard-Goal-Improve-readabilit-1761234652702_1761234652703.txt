Title: Tablet UI and UX polish for Task Management, Projects, and Dashboard

Goal
Improve readability, speed of use, and touch targets for tablet users. Preserve current data and routes. All work is front end only.

General rules
	1.	Target tablet width from 768 to 1024.
	2.	Minimum tap area 48 by 48.
	3.	Use semantic headings and landmarks for screen readers.
	4.	Replace tooltips with visible micro labels or helper text since tablet users do not hover.
	5.	Persist view preferences and filters in localStorage.
	6.	Never remove existing functionality. Add polish and quick actions.
	7.	Keep color contrast above WCAG AA.
	8.	Reuse components across modules.

OverflowMenu
StickyHeader
BottomActionBar
TaskCard
ProjectCard
KpiCard
EmptyState
LoadingSkeleton

Performance
Virtualize long lists with react window in Task Management once there are more than 100 rows.
Show LoadingSkeleton placeholders while data is fetched.

Accessibility
Provide aria labels for all icon buttons.
Ensure focus rings are visible and not removed.

Module work

Task Management module
A. Header and stats
Convert the four top stat cards into StatCard components. Make each card tappable and apply an immediate filter
Total opens no filter
Overdue filters status to overdue
Due this week filters by dueWithin seven days
Completed filters status to done
Keep the stats row sticky when scrolling.
Add small micro copy under each number for clarity. Example Behind schedule and Due within seven.

B. Filters and search
Replace the current long filter row with a compact FilterBar that is sticky below the stats.
Elements inside FilterBar
Search with 250 ms debounce and highlighted matches in results
Status, Priority, People, More filters as chip selectors. When active, show a numeric badge
Clear all button appears only when a filter is active
Save view button persists the current filter set and list grouping in localStorage
Keep Collapse all and Bulk edit but move them to the right in the same bar

C. List and grouping
Keep grouping by project. Convert each group header into a StickyHeader with
Project name
Count of tasks in that group
Expand or collapse control
The Collapse all control should persist the last state across navigation.
TaskCard layout for each row
Left side status dot and drag handle
Title bold line one with truncation
Second line shows project name and location when present
Meta row shows priority pill, assignee AvatarGroup, due date and a small clock icon when overdue
Right side shows SegmentedControl for status quick change In progress Pending Done and an OverflowMenu for secondary actions edit duplicate delete move
Inline quick edits do not navigate away. Use optimistic updates with toast success and rollback on error.
Enable multi select on long press or by tapping a circular checkbox that appears in selection mode. When one or more rows are selected, show BottomActionBar with Change status Change priority Assign Change due date Move Delete

D. Canvas and List toggle
Replace the current Canvas or List buttons with a SegmentedControl placed under the page title. Default to List on tablet. Persist preference in localStorage.

E. Empty and edge states
If a filter returns no items, show an EmptyState with a Create task button that opens the current New Task flow.
If the network fails, show a retry banner and keep the current list onscreen.

Acceptance for Task Management
All stat cards filter correctly
Sticky bars do not overlap content
Expand or collapse states persist
Inline status or priority or assignee updates feel instant and show a toast
Keyboard search and filter clear work
List remains smooth with 500 tasks due to virtualization

Projects module
A. Layout
Use a responsive grid with two columns on tablet and one column on narrow screens. Preserve the List toggle but default to List for tablet.

B. ProjectCard content
Title and status chip Active or On hold
Location and small meta line
Progress bar using percentage with subtle label
Task count
Last updated short date
AvatarGroup for project members
Replace inline edit and delete icons with an OverflowMenu that contains Open Add task Gallery Edit Delete The Delete action must confirm
Make the Gallery button a standard secondary button to reduce confusion

C. Search and filters
Add a search box and filters for status and city in a FilterBar under the header.
Add sort options Recent activity ascending or descending and Name ascending or descending.

D. Create project entry
Move New Project to a floating action button on tablet bottom right that opens a slide over. Keep the original top right button as a secondary path.

E. Empty state
Show an EmptyState with Create your first project when there are none.

Acceptance for Projects
Cards align cleanly in two columns on tablet and no overlap occurs
OverflowMenu actions work
Search and filters combine correctly
Progress bars are consistent height and color

Dashboard module
A. KPI strip
Convert the top four KPIs into KpiCard components with consistent icon size, number, and label. On tablet show a two by two grid. Each card is tappable and deep links into the correct filtered view
Active projects opens Projects with status active
Tasks due today opens Task Management filtered to due today
Completed tasks opens Task Management filtered to done and today
Photos uploaded opens Photos module if it exists

B. Multi project overview
Replace the simple badges with small charts
Average progress shows a sparkline of the last thirty days using Recharts
Budget usage shows a radial gauge
Critical projects shows a count with a view list button that opens a filtered Projects view
Make this block a card with tabs Project overview and Task management already present. Tabs remain sticky when scrolling.

C. Project health grid
Use ProjectCard compact variation with equal heights and consistent spacing.
Each card shows project name, progress, status chip Behind or At risk or On track, and a small mini sparkline.
Fix any text clipping on long names by adding truncation and accessible titles.

D. Alerts
If there are overdue tasks or critical projects, render a dismissible banner at the top with direct links.

Acceptance for Dashboard
All KPI cards link to the correct filters
Charts render without layout shifts
Project health cards do not clip text on tablet
Sticky tabs remain visible when scrolling

Global navigation
Make the left sidebar collapsible on tablet. Remember the collapsed state. Keep icon labels visible when expanded.
Add a breadcrumb under the top bar that reflects the current module and selection.
Ensure all destructive actions open a confirmation dialog.

Testing checklist
Visual test at 768 and 1024
Keyboard and screen reader sweep using Tab and Shift Tab
Touch sweep to verify 48 by 48 targets
Simulate slow network and confirm LoadingSkeleton appears
Verify that localStorage entries for viewPreference and savedFilters are created and restored

Deliverables
New shared components and utilities created as listed above
Refactors in the three modules to use the shared components
No breaking changes in routes, props, or API calls
Brief notes in a README section named tablet ui polish that documents new components and how to use them
