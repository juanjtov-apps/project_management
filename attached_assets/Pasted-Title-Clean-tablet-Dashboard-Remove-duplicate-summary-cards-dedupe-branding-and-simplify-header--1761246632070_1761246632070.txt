Title: Clean tablet Dashboard. Remove duplicate summary cards, dedupe branding, and simplify header

Context
React with Tailwind and shadcn ui. Front end only. Do not change backend or APIs. Target widths from 768 to 1024. Keep colors and icons already used.

Problems to fix on tablet
• Summary cards appear twice. Top KPI strip and a second set inside Multi Project Overview repeat the same information.
• The word Proesphere appears twice at the top which feels redundant with the sidebar brand.
• The header is visually heavy. Too many elements and spacing makes it feel cluttered.

Deliverables
Update Dashboard page structure and shared components. No breaking changes in props or routes.

Changes
	1.	Keep a single KPI strip
• Create src/components/ui/StatCard.tsx if it does not exist. Props icon value label optional sublabel tone onClick.
• Render StatCard only once at the very top in a grid with two columns on tablet and four on desktop. grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 lg:grid-cols-4.
• In Multi Project Overview remove the four repeated stat tiles. Replace them with unique information. Use one of the two approaches below based on available data.
A. Insights chips that are different from the KPIs. Examples Overdue tasks total Projects behind New tasks this week New photos this week.
B. Trend view for the original KPIs. Show only the seven day delta as a small green or red percentage with an up or down arrow. Do not show the base numbers again.
• If a metric is not available hide that chip. Never display placeholders that duplicate the top KPIs.
	2.	Deduplicate branding
• On tablet show the brand only in the left sidebar. Remove the Proesphere text block from the top bar.
• In the top bar show breadcrumb and page title instead. Example Dashboard.
• Keep the user name and role at the far right. Example Carlos small label Project Manager.
	3.	Simplify and tighten the header
• Convert the header to a single compact row with three zones.
Left breadcrumb and page title.
Center tab switch for Project overview Task management Communications Financial health.
Right search icon button notifications bell and avatar menu.
• Target header height 56 to 64. Use px-4 py-2 with gap-3.
• Make the tab row sticky to the correct offset so it remains visible when scrolling. Example wrapper classes sticky top-[headerHeight] z-30 bg-white border-b.
• Ensure minimum tap area 48 by 48 for every icon and tab.
• Remove any duplicate borders where sticky sections meet the content.
	4.	Multi Project Overview card
• Card title at left and small View all projects button at right.
• Inside content use a two column grid. Left side holds the insights chips or trend row. Right side can hold a tiny sparkline or gauge if already available. If no chart is available keep only the insight chips.
• Do not repeat any numbers from the KPI strip.
	5.	Project Health Status grid
• Two columns on tablet. grid grid-cols-2 gap-4.
• Title truncates with min-w-0 and truncate classes.
• Status chip sits in the card header aligned to the right never on top of the title.
• Progress bar height 8 and color consistent across cards.
	6.	Accessibility and keyboard
• All icon buttons have aria-label.
• Keep visible focus rings focus:outline-none focus:ring-4 focus:ring-slate-200.
