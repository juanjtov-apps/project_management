Quick-hit enhancements for the Task Management Canvas
	1.	Global summary bar
Show “41 tasks · 12 overdue · 6 due this week” above the search box so users see workload at a glance.
	2.	Bulk actions
Add check-boxes down the left edge and a sticky bulk-action toolbar (change status, assign, delete) to speed up mass edits.
	3.	Inline editing & keyboard shortcuts
Let users hit E to edit the task title, S to cycle status, and ←/→ to move between fields—cuts mouse travel.
	4.	Project progress pill
Next to each project header, display “3/10 done · 30 %” with a thin progress bar; collapses still show completion at a glance.
	5.	Priority & status chips with color logic
• Low = soft green, Medium = amber, High = red.
• Pending = gray, In-Progress = blue, Blocked = red outline, Done = green outline.
Consistent hues improve scannability.
	6.	Overdue highlight
If the due date < today, tint the task row light red and prepend a ⏰ icon.
	7.	Assignee avatars
Replace the text “Assigned” with a small circular photo (or initials) to add a human cue and save space.
	8.	Sticky filter & view bar
Keep the search, status dropdown, and Canvas/List toggle fixed at the top when scrolling long lists.
	9.	Advanced multi-filter panel
A slide-down sheet for filtering by project, assignee, due range, priority, and tag—then save presets (“My tasks this week”).
	10.	Drag-to-reorder within a project
Enable vertical drag-and-drop so superintendents can prioritize on the fly.
	11.	Expand/Collapse All shortcut
One chevron icon next to “Project Tasks” that toggles every group; saves clicks on large portfolios.
	12.	Empty-state & zero-results messaging
Friendly prompts (“No tasks match these filters. Try clearing priority or date.”) prevent dead-end screens.
	13.	Right-side details drawer
Clicking a task slides in a drawer for notes, attachments, and comment history—instead of a separate edit page.
	14.	Virtualized list rendering
Use react-window or similar to keep scrolling buttery smooth when projects scale to hundreds of tasks.
	15.	Accessibility & contrast checks
Ensure navy text and teal chips meet WCAG 2.1 AA, add ARIA labels to icons, and support full keyboard navigation.
