What’s working better ✅
	1.	Active-state rail – The teal bar in the sidebar is clear and consistent with the Proesphere palette. It’s now easy to see where you are.
	2.	Brand alignment – The teal icons in Quick Actions and the avatar chip in the top-right anchor the interface in the colors we defined.
	3.	Hierarchy of CTAs – Using coral only for “Add Project” starts to create a single focal point, which is exactly what we want.

Next tweaks to tighten the look 👇
	1.	Unify icon colors in the metrics cards
	•	The yellow calendar icon has drifted off-brand. Switch every metric-card icon to Sphere Teal so the trio reads as one component.
	2.	Add subtle elevation to interactive cards
	•	Each metrics card and Quick-Action tile still sits flat. A 1 px #E5E7EB border + a 4 px soft shadow (rgba(0,0,0,0.04)) will give them the “pressable” feel.
	3.	Sidebar background tint
	•	The white sidebar blends into the content area on large screens. Apply a 5 % tint of Deep Space Blue (#1B2E4B0D) or a very pale grey so it feels like its own rail.
	4.	Trim the blank header strip
	•	The empty bar beneath the top nav still burns vertical space. Pull the dashboard cards up so they sit ~24 px below the nav.
	5.	Typography scale
	•	Boost the page title to text-xl font-semibold; keep the sub-headline at text-base text-slate-600. This little bump makes the header feel deliberate.
	6.	Sign-out affordance
	•	Convert “Sign Out” from an outlined button to a text link (text-slate-600, underline on hover). Its current weight competes with primary actions.
	7.	Focus & hover states
	•	Add a visible keyboard focus ring (outline outline-2 outline-offset-2 outline-teal-500/40) to all interactive elements. Hover can be a 2 % darker background on cards for a tactile cue.
	8.	Progress rings for metrics (optional polish)
	•	Consider replacing static numbers with small circular progress indicators (e.g., 7/12 tasks due → 58 %). It gives project managers an instant sense of momentum.

Implementing these small refinements will finish the transition from “good template” to a cohesive, branded command-center interface for Proesphere.
