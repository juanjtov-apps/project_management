Global Design System (apply first)
	•	Introduce tokens + theming
	•	Add CSS variables in :root and @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark):
	•	--brand-50..900, --accent, --bg, --surface, --text, --muted, --success, --warning, --danger, --ring.
	•	Keep brand as deep teal → emerald gradient you’re using; also define navy as the dark neutral.
	•	Tailwind config: extend colors from CSS vars, radius (xl, 2xl), shadow (soft, elevated), spacing, and add container: { center: true, padding: "1rem" }.
	•	Typography
	•	Use fluid type with clamp:
	•	--step--1: clamp(12px, 0.85vw + 10px, 14px)
	•	--step-0: clamp(14px, 1vw + 12px, 16px)
	•	--step-1: clamp(18px, 1.2vw + 14px, 20px) etc.
	•	Set stack to ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Inter.
	•	Add text-balance on headings (CSS property) to avoid awkward line breaks on mobile.
	•	Spacing & density
	•	Standardize vertical rhythm: sections py-8 sm:py-12, cards p-5 sm:p-6, grid gap gap-4 sm:gap-6.
	•	States & accessibility
	•	Consistent focus rings: focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[var(--ring)].
	•	Ensure touch targets ≥ 44x44px; increase icon buttons to h-11 w-11.
	•	Meet WCAG contrast; audit chips (yellow, light grey) and adjust to pass AA.
	•	Reduce motion: respect @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce).
	•	Dark mode
	•	Add class="dark" toggle; all tokens drive both modes automatically.
	•	Safe-area padding
	•	Add padding-inline: env(safe-area-inset-left) env(safe-area-inset-right) for headers/footers on iOS.
	•	Iconography
	•	Use one set (Lucide) at stroke-1.75 and align to 24px grid. No mixed icon weights.

Global Navigation & Layout
	•	Top App Bar
	•	Replace “Sign Out” text on mobile with an avatar button opening a DropdownMenu (Profile, Settings, Sign out).
	•	Make the app bar height 56px mobile / 64px desktop, translucent with blur (backdrop-blur-md bg-bg/80), sticky top-0 z-40.
	•	Drawer / Sheet
	•	Use Sheet component for the sidebar on mobile; collapse the left nav into a hamburger.
	•	Tenant vs Brand naming
	•	In-app header alternates between Proesphere and Premier Building Solutions. Decide and:
	•	Show Proesphere as product brand in the top-left.
	•	Show tenant name below page title or in avatar menu subtitle for clarity.

⸻

Landing Page (mobile-first)
	•	Header cleanup
	•	Align the “Sign In” CTA with brand buttons; remove the dark mismatched pill; use btn-primary style.
	•	Hero
	•	Apply fluid headline with balanced wrap; center on mobile, left on ≥md.
	•	Gradient accent only on the keyword (“Project Management”), not the whole line.
	•	Primary CTA Get Started (filled), secondary Learn More (outline). Keep both full-width on mobile (w-full sm:w-auto).
	•	Trust / logo strip
	•	Convert the contractor chips row into an auto-scroll logo carousel with 16px grey logos and high contrast text quote above.
	•	“See it in action”
	•	Replace plain text with a sticky anchor button that smooth-scrolls to the demo section; add a gentle chevron animation (reduced-motion safe).
	•	Performance
	•	Compress hero illustration; add sizes/srcset, loading="eager" only on hero image; lazy elsewhere.

⸻

Authentication (Login)
	•	Card & alignment
	•	Reduce shadow; use shadow-soft + subtle inner light; center the card vertically with safe-area padding.
	•	Form polish
	•	Add email autofill, autocomplete="username email".
	•	Add show/hide password toggle; autocomplete="current-password".
	•	Inline validation with helper text below fields; disable Sign In until valid.
	•	Add “Forgot password?” link; optional Remember me.
	•	Interactions
	•	Loading state on submit (aria-busy, spinner on button); handle errors with toast + field error.
	•	SSO placeholder
	•	Place a divider “or” and Google/Microsoft SSO buttons (can be disabled until wired).

⸻

Dashboard
	•	Tabs bar
	•	Make tabs scrollable on mobile with underlined indicator; ensure tap targets 44px height.
	•	KPI tiles
	•	Replace colored blocks with subtle surfaces and small trend sparkline; ensure consistent icon alignment.
	•	Use semantic colors: success (green), warning (amber), danger (red) with accessible contrast.
	•	Project Health list
	•	Each project row: title, city, progress bar with % label, status chip (“On Track / At Risk / Behind”), and next date icon.
	•	Bars should animate only when first in viewport.
	•	Recent Activity
	•	Group by day (“Today”, “Yesterday”); capitalize names; link items to detail; relative time + absolute tooltip.
	•	Quick Actions
	•	Replace orange with brand primary; provide four equal buttons; on mobile, expose as a bottom sheet / FAB (“+”) that expands to actions.

⸻

Projects (Cards & List)
	•	Segmented control
	•	Use a native segmented control style (rounded-full, inset indicator). Default to Cards on mobile.
	•	Project card (mobile)
	•	Top: project name + status chip + menu (⋮).
	•	Middle: location + tasks count + quick progress.
	•	Bottom: primary action (“Open”), secondary icons (Tasks, Photos). Remove inline tiny “Gallery” button.
	•	New Project
	•	Turn the large top-right button into a FAB on mobile; desktop keeps button near page title.
	•	Filters
	•	Add top bar chips (Active, On hold, Completed) + sort dropdown (Name, Progress, Updated).

⸻

Photo Gallery
	•	Grid & performance
	•	Replace giant column with a masonry grid (2 cols on mobile, 3–5 on desktop).
	•	Use real thumbnails (webp/avif) and lazy-load with blur-up; preserve EXIF orientation.
	•	Add placeholder skeletons; avoid showing broken-image icons.
	•	Capture UX
	•	On mobile upload, set <input accept="image/*" capture="environment"> for camera.
	•	Allow multi-select, progress indicators, and background uploads with toasts.
	•	Viewer
	•	Lightbox with pinch-zoom, swipe between images, metadata panel (tags, project, timestamp), and quick annotate (simple markup).

⸻

Task Management Canvas (the “in-action” demo block)
	•	Summary header
	•	Make “61 tasks | 12 overdue | 8 due this week | 41 completed” tappable chips that filter the list.
	•	Task item
	•	Increase row height to ≥64px; left: status dot + checkbox; center: title + meta; right: priority chip + assignee avatar.
	•	Replace colored outlines with soft tinted backgrounds for priority chips.
	•	List density
	•	Add space-y-3 between cards; use rounded-xl shadow-soft.
	•	Empty & loading
	•	Show a well-crafted empty state with CTA (“Add your first task”).

⸻

Modals & Sheets
	•	Use Dialog on desktop / Sheet full-height on mobile for photo gallery and edits.
	•	Add aria-modal, focus trap, and scroll lock behind the layer.
	•	Provide a close X plus swipe-down gesture on mobile sheets.

⸻

Forms & Inputs (global)
	•	Normalize inputs via a single Input component (shadcn/ui) with:
	•	44px height, rounded-lg, inner shadow off, outer ring on focus.
	•	Clear icons only when text exists.
	•	Add helper text and error text slots.
	•	Provide destructive button style for deletes; keep brand green/teal for positive CTAs only.

⸻

Micro-interactions
	•	Button press: scale 0.98 on active (reduced motion guarded).
	•	Hover → elevation bump; focus → ring; disabled → lowered contrast.
	•	Toasts for create/update/delete; non-blocking.

⸻

Content & Copy
	•	Ensure consistent capitalization: Premier Building Solutions (tenant) vs Proesphere (product).
	•	Standardize date format and pluralization (e.g., “1 task”, “2 tasks”).
	•	Replace “0% complete – Behind” everywhere with neutral “Not started” until a baseline exists.

⸻

Performance & Quality
	•	Add rel="preload" for primary font; use only variable font weights actually used (400/500/600).
	•	Convert large images to AVIF/WebP, serve correct sizes for mobile.
	•	Defer non-critical scripts; use IntersectionObserver to hydrate charts/lists lazily.
	•	Lighthouse pass ≥95 for Performance/Accessibility/Best Practices/SEO.
