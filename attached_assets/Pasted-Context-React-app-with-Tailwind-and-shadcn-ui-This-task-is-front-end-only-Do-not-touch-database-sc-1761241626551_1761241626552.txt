Context
React app with Tailwind and shadcn ui. This task is front end only. Do not touch database schemas, API contracts, or backend routes. Target tablet widths from 768 to 1024. The goal is to remove clipping, align components, improve spacing, and ensure fast touch use.

Key problems visible on tablet
• Long project names in Project Health Status overflow into neighboring cards and clip
• The active chip overlaps text and pushes layout
• KPI cards have inconsistent heights and icon sizing
• The tab row under the KPI strip is not sticky to the correct offset and wastes vertical space
• Card gutters and progress bar heights are inconsistent
• Risk of double scroll in content region and sticky elements overlapping content

Deliverables
Create or update shared components and utilities only in the front end. Update Dashboard composition to use them. Keep existing props and routes.

Work plan
	1.	Layout and container
• Wrap dashboard content in a container with max width and consistent side padding
Example for the page content wrapper
className: mx auto max w screen lg px 6 md px 8
• Ensure the main scroll area is the page content div not the whole document to keep sticky elements stable
parent: overflow hidden
scroller: overflow auto
	2.	Sticky tab row
• Make the tab row below the KPI strip sticky with the correct offset
className on the tab row container
sticky top 16 z 30 bg white border b border slate 200 px 2 py 2
Adjust top to match header height if the header differs
• Remove any extra vertical padding so it occupies one compact row
• Ensure no horizontal scroll is introduced at tablet widths
	3.	KPI cards
• Build a StatCard component and replace the four KPI tiles
Props: icon value label sublabel optional tone
Layout
container: rounded 2xl bg white ring 1 ring slate 200 p 4 shadow sm min h 88 flex items center gap 4
icon wrapper: h 12 w 12 rounded xl bg slate 50 text slate 600 flex items center justify center
value: text 2xl font semibold leading tight
label: text sm text slate 500
sublabel when present: text xs text slate 400
• Place the four KPI cards in a grid with two columns on tablet and four on desktop
grid grid cols 2 gap 4 md gap 6 lg grid cols 4
• Ensure each card is fully tappable and has aria labels
	4.	Multi project overview card
• Inside the card use a grid with two columns on tablet
grid grid cols 2 gap 4
• Use a shared MiniMetric component for Average progress Budget usage Critical projects New this week
Equal heights and consistent typography
• Buttons inside the card use size small and do not shift layout
	5.	Project Health Status grid
• Use a two column grid on tablet
grid grid cols 2 gap 4
• Card height and spacing
card: rounded 2xl bg white ring 1 ring slate 200 p 4 shadow sm flex flex col gap 3
• Fix title overflow and cross column clipping
On the text container add min w 0
On the title add truncate and title attribute
