Task Module (Mobile) – Checklist (Palette-Safe)
1) Layout & Spacing

 Increase vertical spacing between task cards (space-y-3) for better touch separation.

 Ensure each task card has consistent padding (p-4 on mobile).

 Reduce excessive horizontal whitespace inside task rows to fit better on narrow screens.

2) Typography & Truncation

 Truncate long task names with ellipsis (truncate + tooltip on hover/long press).

 Use two-line clamp for task descriptions (line-clamp-2) instead of overflowing text.

 Standardize text hierarchy:

Task name → font-medium text-base.

Labels/meta (project name, due date, assigned) → text-sm text-muted.

3) Chips (Status, Priority, Tags)

 Make chips uniform height (h-7 px-3 rounded-full text-xs font-medium).

 Ensure consistent order: [Priority] [Status].

 Wrap chips if space runs out (use flex-wrap gap-2).

 Add margin between chips and task title for clarity.

4) Controls & Actions

 Resize dropdowns/buttons:

Status dropdown → h-9 min-w-[110px] for tap comfort.

Edit/Delete icons → h-10 w-10 with rounded-lg touch targets.

 Move delete button away from dropdown (to avoid accidental taps).

 Ensure bulk actions (Collapse, Bulk Edit) collapse into a dropdown on mobile.

5) Hierarchy & Grouping

 Show project group header (Project Tasks, Brookfield, etc.) as sticky when scrolling in its section (sticky top-[offset] bg-white z-10).

 Collapse project sections by default on mobile; allow expand with chevron.

 Display task count in project header with consistent pill style (rounded-full bg-gray-100 px-2 text-xs).

6) Icons & Indicators

 Use a consistent left-aligned icon stack (status/check, project, due date) → prevents clutter.

 Show due date with calendar icon + date inline, not floating in red text.

 Overdue → keep red text, but attach icon + label (e.g., “Due: 8/23/2025”).

7) Scrolling & Filters

 Make status/priority filters horizontally scrollable (overflow-x-auto flex-nowrap).

 Keep filter row sticky under task summary on mobile.

 Add a “Clear Filters” chip for quick reset.

8) Performance & Interactions

 Add skeleton loaders for tasks when fetching.

 Swipe gesture on task row: left → delete, right → complete (optional progressive enhancement).

 Toast confirmation for destructive actions (delete, bulk edit).

9) Accessibility

 Ensure task rows and controls are ≥ 44px tall.

 Add aria-labels: e.g., “Mark task Final CRUD Test as In Progress.”

 Focus ring visible on all chips, dropdowns, and buttons.
