1. Global color hierarchy
	•	Issue: Screen looks mostly monochrome; off-brand yellow icons feel random.
	•	Fix:
	•	Primary chrome (sidebar background, top-nav text) → Deep Space Blue #1B2E4B.
	•	Active/selected states → Sphere Teal #1FA77C.
	•	High-priority CTAs → Spark Coral #FF7849.
	•	Replace yellow calendar/check icons with teal or coral versions that match their purpose.

2. Sidebar
	•	Issue: Active link is just a navy pill; no clear context rail.
	•	Fix:
	•	Give the entire sidebar a 5 % tint of Deep Space Blue to separate it from content.
	•	Add a 4 px Sphere Teal bar (or full-width pill) beside the active link so users always know where they are.

3. Metrics cards (Active Projects / Tasks Due / Completed)
	•	Issue: Counts feel light and icons float awkwardly.
	•	Fix:
	•	Add a subtle 1 px #E5E7EB border and soft shadow so cards feel touchable.
	•	Boost numbers to bold 2 xl, dim the labels slightly.
	•	Re-color icons in Sphere Teal for visual consistency.

4. Quick-Actions grid
	•	Issue: Buttons look like empty cards; nothing signals a primary action.
	•	Fix:
	•	Treat every tile as a real button: on hover, invert to Deep Space Blue text on Sphere Teal ghost background.
	•	Use Spark Coral for the single most critical action (e.g., “Add Project”).
	•	Stack icon above label and keep icon stroke weight uniform.

5. Recent Activity panel
	•	Issue: Feels sparse and text-heavy.
	•	Fix:
	•	Add a 2 px Sphere Teal border-left (or dot) beside each item to signal status.
	•	Dim relative time (“2 h ago”) to slate-500 and smaller text so the description pops.
	•	Limit to five items with a View all link in Coral.

6. Whitespace & rhythm
	•	Issue: Giant empty band above the dashboard header; inconsistent gutters.
	•	Fix:
	•	Constrain overall width (max-w-[1440px] mx-auto).
	•	Adopt an 8-pt spacing system (8/16/24/32) for predictable gaps.
	•	Drop the blank space above “Dashboard” so hero cards sit 24 px below the nav.

7. Typography
	•	Issue: Headers and body text share similar weight.
	•	Fix:
	•	Page titles → font-semibold text-xl.
	•	Numeric data → tabular-nums for easy scanning.
	•	Establish a clear h1→h4 scale for accessibility.

8. Sign-out & profile section
	•	Issue: “Sign Out” button carries the same weight as CTAs.
	•	Fix:
	•	Make it a text link (text-slate-600, Coral underline on hover).
	•	Swap the plain “Root” text for an avatar chip to humanize the UI.

9. Accessibility & interaction states
	•	Issue: Hover/focus indicators are faint; some contrast may fail.
	•	Fix:
	•	Check all key pairs for ≥ 4.5:1 contrast.
	•	Use a clear Sphere Teal/40 focus ring for keyboard navigation.

10. Future polish ideas
	•	Inject micro-animations: cards fade in, Quick-Action icons nudge on hover.
	•	Offer a dark-mode toggle (invert neutrals, keep Teal as primary).
	•	Replace static counts with subtle progress rings—project managers love instant signal.

Implement the color tokens in your Tailwind (or CSS-in-JS) config first, then refactor sidebar and buttons—the quickest wins for a cohesive Proesphere look.
