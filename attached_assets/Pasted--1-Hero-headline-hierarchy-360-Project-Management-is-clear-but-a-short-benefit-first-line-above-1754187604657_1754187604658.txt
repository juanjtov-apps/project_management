	1.	Hero headline hierarchy
“360° Project Management” is clear, but a short benefit-first line above it (e.g., “Your Construction Command Center”) can hook scanners before they process the angle + descriptor.
	2.	Micro-copy under CTA
The “Free 14-day trial. No credit card.” note is excellent—raise it one step up (closer to the buttons) and bump to text-sm so it isn’t lost.
	3.	Primary vs. secondary buttons
Visually, Get Started (filled navy) and Learn More (outlined teal) feel balanced—good. Add a subtle hover shadow to both for tactile feedback and keep the outline width identical (the teal outline looks 0.5 px lighter).
	4.	Social-proof strip
• Love the single testimonial quote + muted logo chips.
• Tighten vertical space: shrink chip padding so the testimonial and logos feel like one band, not two separate sections.
• Consider fading logos to 60 % opacity to keep focus on the quote.
	5.	Sticky / disappearing nav
The nav currently stays static and white; adding a slight drop shadow once the user scrolls 24 px makes it distinct from body content and anchors the eye.
	6.	Subtle background texture
The large white expanse above the fold can feel empty on wide monitors. A faint blueprint grid or diagonal dot pattern at 4 % opacity behind the hero adds construction flavor without weight.
	7.	Scroll cue
A down-chevron or “Scroll to see it in action” micro-animation beneath the CTAs nudges visitors to the Task-Canvas preview.
	8.	Task-Canvas preview card
• The embedded dashboard card looks crisp; add a soft 16 px blur shadow (rgba(0,0,0,0.06)) so it floats.
• Try a gentle 3-sec autoplay GIF (or Lottie) that cycles a status change—motion sells “live” better than static.
	9.	Section padding consistency
Ensure equal top/bottom padding for each horizontal band (hero, proof, canvas). The proof strip feels 16 px tighter than the others.
	10.	Button color reuse
The teal outline on Learn More matches the progress bars below—nice. Repeat that teal for other outline buttons further down (e.g., View Calendar) to strengthen brand identity.
	11.	Font-weight alignment
In the scrolled view, project names (cards) are font-medium but task titles are regular. Making both medium creates a consistent reading rhythm.
	12.	State chips contrast
The red Critical chip passes contrast but the amber Medium chip borders on WCAG minimum. Darken amber slightly or switch chip text to dark grey.
	13.	Card gutters on large screens
On ≥1440 px width, the canvas card floats in lots of whitespace. Consider a max-width container (e.g., 1180 px) and center it so eyes aren’t tracking too far horizontally.
	14.	Footer prompt
Even a slim “Have questions? → Chat with us” sticky bubble (bottom-right) increases conversion for undecided visitors without cluttering hero real estate.
	15.	Mobile check
• Verify logo chips wrap to two rows gracefully.
• Stack CTAs vertically with equal width; outline teal button often feels too small when shrunk.

Apply 3–4 of these (nav shadow, scroll cue, chip contrast, GIF in dashboard preview) and the page will feel both more alive and more polished—without re-architecting the layout.
