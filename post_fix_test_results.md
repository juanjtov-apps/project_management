## üéØ ISSUES SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED

### ‚úÖ Issue 1: Dashboard Performance Optimization
**Problem:** Dashboard stats endpoint was slow (1340ms response time)
**Solution:** Optimized SQL query from 4 separate queries to 1 combined CTE query
**Result:** Response time reduced from **1340ms to 341ms** (75% performance improvement)

```sql
-- BEFORE: 4 separate queries
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM projects WHERE status = 'active'
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tasks WHERE status IN ('pending', 'in-progress')
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM photos
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM photos WHERE DATE(created_at) = today

-- AFTER: 1 optimized CTE query
WITH project_stats AS (...), task_stats AS (...), photo_stats AS (...)
SELECT ps.active_projects, ts.pending_tasks, phs.total_photos...
```

### ‚úÖ Issue 2: RBAC Company Creation Fixed
**Problem:** POST `/rbac/companies` returning 500 error due to incorrect schema mapping
**Solution:** 
- Fixed column mapping (description/industry ‚Üí domain/status)
- Proper JSONB handling with psycopg2.extras.Json
- Added validation for required fields

**Result:** Company creation now working properly
```bash
Status: 200 ‚úÖ
{
  "id": 4,
  "name": "Test Company Unique 2025",
  "domain": "uniquetest2025.com", 
  "status": "active",
  "settings": {"test": true},
  "createdAt": "2025-07-31T22:11:27.013491"
}
```

### ‚úÖ Issue 3: Error Handling Improvements
**Problem:** Some endpoints not returning proper HTTP status codes
**Solution:** Enhanced catch-all route to return proper 404 errors for non-existent API endpoints
**Result:** Better error response consistency
